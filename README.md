# ⚽ FIFA World Cup 2026 Prediction Engine

> End-to-end ML + simulation pipeline to forecast the FIFA World Cup 2026 — featuring XGBoost team capability modelling, Poisson match simulation, and 10,000-run Monte Carlo tournament prediction.

## 📌 Overview

The 2026 FIFA World Cup introduced an expanded 48-team format, making traditional prediction methods less reliable. This project builds a two-stage prediction engine:

1. **ML Stage** — XGBoost regressor trained on historical World Cup data (2014–2022) predicts how far each of the 48 teams will progress.
2. **Simulation Stage** — A Poisson-based match simulator runs 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations of the official bracket to estimate win probabilities for every team.

The result: data-driven tournament winner probabilities grounded in historical performance, Elo ratings, and squad statistics.

```

### Stage 1 — EDA & Key Findings

- **Elo rating** is the strongest predictor of tournament progression, with a correlation of **0.68**
- **Defence > Attack**: `goals_conceded_per_game` accounts for **13.8%** of split importance vs only **4.1%** for `goals_scored_per_game` — keeping clean sheets matters 3× more than scoring
- High multicollinearity (VIF > 50) in interaction terms necessitated comparing linear vs tree-based models

### Stage 2 — Machine Learning

Three models evaluated using **Leave-One-Group-Out Cross Validation** (held out by tournament year — 2014, 2018, 2022 in rotation):

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|-------|-----|------|-----|
| Ridge Regression | — | — | — |
| Random Forest | — | — | — |
| **XGBoost** ✅ | **0.676** | **1.075** | **0.450** |

**XGBoost selected** — average error of less than one round in predicting exit stage.

### Stage 3 — Monte Carlo Simulation

Each match is simulated using a **Poisson goal model**:
- Expected goals drawn from Poisson distribution parameterised by team strength
- Team strength = hybrid score combining Elo rating and ML-predicted stage
- 10,000 full tournament simulations run for both a randomised draw and the official 2026 bracket
- Win probability = fraction of simulations where a team lifts the trophy
